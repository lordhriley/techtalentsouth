      "This Twitch Streamer is also one of the top Twitch streamers and has the fastest growing Twitch channel in Twitch history. He is known to spend over 70 hours live on Twitch each week, and he also has the fourth highest number of followers on the most-watched Fortnite channel. With the fourth highest follower count, Tfue has more followers than the second - and most - watched Twitch channel of all time.\n",
      "According to Twitch, in 2020, there will be over 100 events per day with over 1,000 players from over 50 countries and more than 1.5 million viewers. Twitch Rivals is one of the most popular esports events on Twitch and the second largest esports event in the world after Dota 2.\n",
      "This will be the second time chess is introduced in Twitch Rivals, where the best chess variants come together on Twitch to compete in a higher difficulty. A pandemic that is forcing more users online has boosted Twitch as a factor in that growth. After Microsoft's decision to close the Microsoft Mixer, Unikrn has developed its own version of the popular online game platform TwitchMixer.\n",
      "Viewing growth was 101 per cent in April compared to the previous year, 60 per cent in March and the second highest in May and June.\n",
      "With over 3 billion hours in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase in that number per second, Amazon's video game platform Twitch is the official leader in viewing the most popular video games on the world's largest video game streaming platform. The list of most-watched Twitch streamers is ranked by the number of streams per hour, according to Twitch's annual report of December 1, 2017.\n",
      "This popularity can lead to a variety of opportunities for a streamer in the world of video game streaming, and there is a lot of money that can be made with the service itself. Although there are many other benefits to earning a following on Twitch, the rewards for streamers often exceed the potential revenue they could earn as a sports professional.\n",
      "While cracking the top 5 streamer list on Twitch can be seen as reaching the zenith of success, this elite group is in a constant state of flux. LIRIK, asmongold and xqcow made it into Twitch's top five for the first time in 2019, but that changed dramatically in April, May and June. TFue, Shoud and Ninja all briefly hopped around the list before each making it back into the top 10.\n",
      "The top five streamers on Twitch may change every quarter, but the only thing that has been consistent over the past two months is that the majority use StreamElements for their production, monetization and engagement. Pokimane, one of the world's leading gaming sites, has a growing following of 5.6 million fans on Twitch. It is one of Twitch's most popular streamers and can earn a lot of money at the end of each month.\n",
      "He plays Fortnite and League of Legends, but he also streams food and entertainment of all kinds on his Twitch channel and YouTube channel.\n",
      "He made it to the big time on Twitch and represents one of the most popular Twitch channels in the esports world with more than 1.5 million monthly active users.\n",
      "DrLupo is a player who streams videos from Fortnite and Call of Duty, and he has one of the fastest growing channels on Twitch with more than 1.5 million monthly active users.

      "He is an active Twitch streamer who spends 65 to 70 hours live every week and does not discuss games, predictions, news or problems.\n",
      "The Twitch Streamer is the most popular Fortnite in-game video and posts a variety of games and other videos.

He also works with many other top players, especially the top players in Dota2 and Overwatch.\n",
      "His estimated income is around $5.4 million a year, making him one of the most popular Twitch streamers in the world of esports. Shroud is a Polish Candian Streamer who was one of the leading content developers on Twitch until he left Microsoft Mixer and left the Twitch platform.\n",
